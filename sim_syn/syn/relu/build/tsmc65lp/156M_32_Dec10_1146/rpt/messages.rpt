  4   Info  GLO-51     Hierarchical instance automatically ungrouped.     
                       Hierarchical instances can be automatically        
                       ungrouped to allow for better area or timing       
                       optimization. You can control auto ungrouping      
                       using the root-level attribute 'auto_ungroup'.     
                       You can skip individual instances or modules       
                       using the attribute 'ungroup_ok'.                  
  4 Warning LBR-101    Unusable clock gating integrated cell.

                       attribute 'dont_use' false in the library.

  1   Info  LBR-40     An unsupported construct was detected in this      
                       library.                                           
                       Check to see if this construct is really needed    
                       for synthesis. Many liberty constructs are not     
                       actually required.                                 
  1   Info  LBR-41     An output library pin lacks a function attribute.  
                       If the remainder of this library cell's semantic   
                       checks are successful, it will be considered as a  
                       timing-model (because one of its outputs does not  
                       have a valid function.                             
  1   Info  LBR-412    Created nominal operating condition.               
                       The nominal operating condition represents either  
                       the nominal PVT values if specified in the         
                       library source, or the default PVT values (1.0,    
                       1.0, 1.0).                                         
  1   Info  LBR-415    Found unusable library cells.                      
                       For more information, refer to 'Cells Identified   
                       as Unusable' in the 'User Guide'. The reason why   
                       a cell is considered unusable is stored in the     
                       'unusable_reason' libcell attribute.               
 20   Info  LBR-436    Could not find an attribute in the library.        
  1   Info  LBR-518    Missing a function attribute in the output pin     
                       definition.                                        
 20 Warning LBR-9      Library cell has no output pins defined.           
                       Add the missing output pin(s), then reload the     
                       library. Otherwise, the library cell will be       
                       marked as unusable and as timing model.
